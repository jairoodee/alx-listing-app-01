# Milestone 3: Property Detail Page Implementation

## Project Description
This project focuses on implementing a responsive Property Detail Page for a listing application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The page dynamically displays comprehensive property information including images, descriptions, amenities, reviews, and a booking section. The implementation follows modern web development practices with reusable components and responsive design principles.

## Learning Objectives
* Implement dynamic routing in Next.js for property detail pages
* Create reusable React components for property display
* Structure a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
* Manage component state and props effectively
* Implement interactive elements like date pickers and tabs
* Display and organize property data in an intuitive UI
* Follow best practices for component composition

## Requirements
1. Dynamic Routing: Implement [id].tsx to handle dynamic property pages
2. Component Structure:
    * PropertyDetail (main container component)
    * BookingSection (handles reservation functionality)
    * ReviewSection (displays user feedback)
3. Responsive Design: Ensure proper display on all screen sizes
4. Data Handling: Properly type and manage property data
5. UI Elements:
    * Image gallery/grid
    * Amenities listing
    * Rating display
    * Booking form with date selection
    * Review cards with user info

## Best Practices
1. Component Design:
    * Single Responsibility Principle for components
    * Proper TypeScript typing for props and data
    * Reusable UI components
2. Styling:
    * Consistent spacing and typography
    * Mobile-first approach
    * Proper use of Tailwind utility classes
3. Code Organization:
    * Clear folder structure
    * Separation of concerns
    * Proper component composition
4. Performance:
    * Optimized image display
    * Efficient data handling
    * Lazy loading where appropriate

## Implementation Details
1. PropertyDetail.tsx
The main container component that: - Displays property header with name, rating, and location - Shows an image grid (with main image prominently displayed) - Contains property description in tabbed format - Lists amenities with appropriate icons - Integrates the BookingSection and ReviewSection

2. BookingSection.tsx
A fixed-position component that: - Displays pricing information - Provides date selection controls - Calculates and shows total cost - Includes reservation CTA button

3. ReviewSection.tsx
A component that: - Displays all property reviews - Shows reviewer avatars and ratings - Formats review content properly - Handles pagination if needed

## Expected Outcomes
* A fully responsive property detail page
* Properly structured components that can be reused
* Clean, maintainable code following best practices
* Intuitive user interface with all required functionality
* Proper data handling and typing throughout the application
